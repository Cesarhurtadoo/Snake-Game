# Snake Eater

Snake Eater is a simple yet addictive game built using PyGame, a popular Python library for game development.

## Overview

Snake Eater is a classic snake game where the player controls a snake on a bounded playing field. The objective is to eat food pellets that appear randomly on the screen while avoiding collisions with the snake's own body and the boundaries of the playing field. As the snake eats food, it grows longer, making the game more challenging.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive controls: Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to control the movement of the snake.
- Increasing difficulty: The game difficulty can be adjusted by changing the frame rate, making the snake move faster or slower.
- Score tracking: Keep track of your score as you eat food pellets. The score increases with each food pellet eaten.
- Game over screen: When the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the playing field, the game ends, and a game over screen is displayed.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) or the WASD keys to control the direction of the snake.
2. Eat the food pellets (white squares) that appear randomly on the screen.
3. Avoid collisions with the snake's own body and the boundaries of the playing field.
4. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install PyGame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

3. Clone or download the Snake Eater repository.
4. Run the `snake_eater.py` file using Python:

```bash
python snake_eater.py
```

## Controls

- Use the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) or the WASD keys to control the snake's movement.
- Press ESC to quit the game at any time.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the game, such as the difficulty level, colors, and window size, by modifying the variables at the beginning of the `snake_eater.py` file.
